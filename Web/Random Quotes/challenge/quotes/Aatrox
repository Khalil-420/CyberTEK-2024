Primitives worship me, hoping for mercy. I shall give them death.
I will drown them in oceans of blood!
I will snuff out the light, I shall make darkness eternal!
I am oblivion, I am destruction... I am doom.
I must destroy even hope.
Gods and mortals, they deserve only death!
They will call me a god killer!
I am not a king, I am not a god, I am... worse...
Those who call me enemy, I welcome them.
See your World-Ender!
