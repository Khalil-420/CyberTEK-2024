Someone's day's about to get wrecked.
Time to start some trouble.
Ahâ€¦ that fresh start smell.
Zaun is the future.
Time doesn't heal all wounds.
Tomorrow's the last of my worries.
I'd rather make mistakes than make nothing at all.
My pasts have a way of catching up.
Every rule needs a break.
Back to going forward.
