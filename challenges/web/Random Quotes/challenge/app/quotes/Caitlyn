The law bends for no one.
Crime is common, logic is rare.
Me, miss? Not by a long shot.
I must always be three steps ahead.
I'm not here to serve. I'm here to protect.
My duty is to protect the citizens of Piltover, and I will see that through.
I'm placing my trust in you lot. Let's see this case through... and try not to disappoint me.
It should be progress, not power and fear, that leads Piltover into the future.
